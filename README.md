# Welcome to Project 3!


A simple kick-the-tires sample web application that demostrates use of NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB built in one 5-day week as our team-based project 3 for WDI students at General Assembly ~ Atlanta in May 2016.

#### Your outlet for creative writing!
The sample app is a Create Writing site, where a user can find or write a writing Prompt, and then write a Story from the Prompt, while securely used CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations because of the Authentication and Authorization features from Passport, authentication middleware for Node.js.


## Installation


**STEPS for Installing**

1. `git clone URL`
2. Issue the CD command into the directory
3. `npm install`
4. `nodemon start`
5. and launch your browser to http://localhost:3000/

The live app lives over on our production Heroku server at: *<URL-link>*



## Usage

*TODO: Write better usage instructions*

With the browser window open, navagate to the homepage at /

The user can signup, login, create a prompt and then write a story and logout.

## History

We wrote lots of sample routes, and tried embedding stories in prompts and prompts in users, much like a sample ToDo app might, but found we needed to Link, rather then embed our data. We had lots of samples and false turns to go down in the first 2 days.
