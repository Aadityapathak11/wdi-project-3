### User Stories

As a ***Writer***, I want to ***find new prompts***
to ***practice my creative writing***


----------

- A USER can SignUp.
- A USER can Login.
- A USER can View About page.
- A USER can Create Prompts.
- A USER can View Prompts.
- A USER can Create Story from a Prompt.

- in theory, any USER can see the whole list of Prompts, and Stories.

- in theory, any USER can View the USER page of the author of a Story by following a link from the Story View page. 
(right now, we don't collect penNames, so the only user thing we can show is the email, or password, which we do NOT want to display)

- in theory, a logged-in authenticated USER can Edit and Delete their own Prompts, if the Prompt is not used in a Story.

- in theory, a logged-in authenticated USER can Edit and Delete their own Stories.

----------
I suspect these user stories will change in time.
