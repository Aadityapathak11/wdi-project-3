# Sample Project 3

This is our sample project 3. 

We decided to use these guidelines;

- **Use One GitHub Repo**
- **Use Feature Branches** (new feature branch for each new step)
- **Pull Before Merging**
- **Deploy From Master Branch**


## Gokemon's steps ##
- ***git clone URL***
- ***git checkout -b feature1***
	
	which moved me onto featured branch, is this also consided the "working tree"

	Created a file, and edited it

- ***git add -A***
- ***git commit -m "comment"***
- ***git status***
- ***git checkout master***
	
	moved me back onto master, 

	getting ready to push to GitHub

- ***git pull***
- ***git merge feature1***
	
	merging my featured branch back into master

- ***git status***
- ***git push***
	
	required my userID and password

## Repeat as needed ##
